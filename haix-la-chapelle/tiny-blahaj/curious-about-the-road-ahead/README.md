## Tiny Blåhaj: curious about the road ahead - OSINT

- **Author:** Tschotsch
- **Description:**<br>   
<p>Relieved to finally know where in which city it currently is, the tiny Blåhaj settled back into its seat. But soon, curiosity began to bubble up again — where was this green bus actually heading? What new adventures might await at the end of the line? The flag is haix{busline_final-destination} (i.e. haix{123c4_atlantis}, Tiny Blåhaj reminds you: the flag is all lowercase!). (This challenges is a continuation of "Tiny Blåhaj: lost and looking for help " and refers to the same data)<p>

As we already know, the tiny Blåhaj is träwelling in a FlixBus and is currently somewhere in Dortmund.

The FlixBus website has a tracker available for which you can lookup nine days worth of rides on all their busses.
What we first thought was that maybe the bus started or had a stop in Aachen, as the organizers are based Aachen, home of the great Printe!

We noticed that on the challenge picture, the bus was going in the direction of the police station and the nearest FlixBus station is Dortmund ZOB which is where the bus is supposedly coming from.

So we searched and tried many buslines that started or had a stop in Aachen and Dortmund ZOB (the central bus station) to no avail.

After a while, one of our players asked if we had already checked the exif data and the group that was working on the challenge just groaned at our silly mistake.

Because for most OSINT challenges revolving around images, the most beginner 101 strategy is to first look at the metadata which we all forgot to check.

The metadata (EXIF) of the challenge picture revealed a timestamp (**2025:10:24 16:24:33**):

Now having a timestamp we can cross-reference the weekday and time with the current FlixBus data (Friday, 16:24):

![FlixBus](./assets/flixbus.png)

As we can see, the bus departed from Dortmund ZOB at 16:10 which lines up with our timestamp.

The final destination for this bus is Medyka, Poland.

So the final flag is haix{n1360b_medyka}
